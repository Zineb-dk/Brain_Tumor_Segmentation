# Brain_Tumor_Segmentation
Implementation of a widely used deep learning architecture (U-Net) for the task of automatic brain tumor segmentation using multi-parametric MRI scans. It uses the BraTS 2020 dataset, which provides annotated MRI images with labels identifying different tumor regions: the necrotic/non-enhancing core, peritumoral edema, and the GD-enhancing tumor.
